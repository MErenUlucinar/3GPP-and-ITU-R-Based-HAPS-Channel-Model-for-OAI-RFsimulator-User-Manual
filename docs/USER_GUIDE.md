OAI RFsimulator HAPS Channel Model — User Guide

This guide describes how to configure, run, and verify version v0.1.0 of the
experimental HAPS channel model for OpenAirInterface (OAI) RFsimulator.

This software is a research prototype. It is not an official 3GPP or ITU
conformance implementation.

1. Scope of v0.1.0

The current version models a static HAPS-to-UE radio link and applies the
resulting large-scale channel effects to RFsimulator IQ samples.

The implemented processing path is:

OAI configuration
        ↓
HAPS–UE geometry
        ↓
Large-scale propagation losses
        ↓
Integer-sample delay, IQ attenuation, and fixed Doppler
        ↓
RFsimulator receive path

The release supports:

Static WGS-84 HAPS and UE coordinates

Slant range, elevation angle, and one-way propagation delay

Free-space path loss (FSPL)

Forced LOS, forced NLOS, and probabilistic LOS/NLOS selection

3GPP-based clutter loss and shadow fading

ITU-R-based building entry, atmospheric gas, and rain losses

Integer-sample propagation delay

IQ amplitude attenuation

Optional fixed Doppler with continuous phase

Separate uplink and downlink channel contexts

2. Prerequisites

Before integrating the model, prepare:

A Linux development environment supported by OAI

A working OAI RFsimulator build

The HAPS source and header files

A HAPS channel configuration file

A compatible OAI source revision

The public release should identify the exact tested OAI commit or tag. OAI file
paths and build commands may change between revisions, so use the revision
specified by the release rather than an arbitrary current branch.

3. Source Modules

Module

        ↓
haps_channel
        ↓
simulator.cpp

4. OAI Integration Overview

At a high level, integration requires the following changes in the compatible
OAI source tree:

Add the HAPS source and header files to the RFsimulator implementation.

Register the HAPS_3GPP_ITU channel type in OAI's channel model mapping.

Add the HAPS sources to the relevant CMake target.

Create a HAPS channel context for each selected UL or DL link.

Connect haps_channel_process() to the RFsimulator receive path.

Transfer the calculated integer delay to OAI's channel_offset mechanism.

Add the hapsmod configuration records.

This release reuses OAI's channel selection, link management, receive path, and
integer-sample offset mechanisms. The HAPS-specific geometry and propagation
calculations are implemented in separate modules.

5. Configuration

HAPS parameters are read from the hapsmod list in
channelmod_haps_3gpp_itu.conf. A separate record can be used for each link:

rfsimu_channel_enB0   # Downlink channel record
rfsimu_channel_ue0    # Uplink channel record

The model_name requested by RFsimulator must match the corresponding
hapsmod record. If the names do not match, the HAPS configuration cannot be
associated with that link.

5.1 Core Parameters

The main configuration groups are:

Group

Examples

Radio

Centre frequency and sample rate

Geometry

HAPS and UE latitude, longitude, and altitude

Environment

scenario, LOS mode, and terminal type

Randomization

random_seed

Calibration

link_budget_offset_db

Optional effects

Clutter, shadow fading, BEL, gas, rain, delay, and Doppler flags

Atmospheric inputs

Pressure, temperature, water-vapour density, and integrated water vapour

Rain inputs

Rain rate, rain height, and polarization angle

Supported LOS operating modes are:

forced_los: always use the LOS state

forced_nlos: always use the NLOS state

probabilistic: compare a seeded random draw with the 3GPP LOS probability

5.2 Recommended Initial Configuration

Start with a simple deterministic baseline:

Scenario       : rural
LOS mode       : forced_los
Terminal       : outdoor
HAPS altitude  : 20 km
Carrier        : 3.6192 GHz
Sample rate    : 61.44 Msps
Fixed Doppler  : 0 Hz

Enable additional loss components one at a time. This makes it easier to
verify which component changes the final channel loss.

5.3 Configuration Behavior

Outdoor terminals produce zero building entry loss.

LOS links produce zero clutter loss in the current implementation.

Shadow fading is generated only when its enable flag is active.

A fixed random_seed makes probabilistic LOS and shadow-fading realizations
repeatable.

The RFsimulator runtime frequency and sample rate take precedence when they
are supplied to the HAPS channel context.

link_budget_offset_db is a simulation calibration value; it is not a
physical propagation loss.

6. Running the Model

Use the normal startup procedure of the compatible OAI RFsimulator setup:

Select HAPS_3GPP_ITU for the required UL and DL channel records.

Load the configuration containing the corresponding hapsmod entries.

Build OAI with the HAPS source files included in the RFsimulator target.

Start RFsimulator and the gNB using the tested OAI procedure.

Start the UE.

Check the console for HAPS ACTIVE and HAPS DELAY ACTIVE messages.

Exact build and launch commands must be documented together with the tested OAI
commit because command-line options and source paths can differ between OAI
revisions.

7. Understanding the Logs

A typical channel log contains fields similar to:

HAPS ACTIVE: link=rfsimu_channel_enB0 direction=DL
slant=20.000 km elevation=90.00 deg LOS=1 pLOS=0.998
FSPL=129.64 dB CL=0.00 dB sigmaSF=0.72 dB SF=0.00 dB

fractional_residual=0.835602 applied_delay=66.715495 us

8. Core Calculations

The one-way propagation delay is:

\tau = \frac{d_{\mathrm{slant}}}{c}

The exact delay in samples is:

N_{\mathrm{exact}} = \tau F_s

Version v0.1.0 uses upward integer quantization:

N_{\mathrm{integer}} = \left\lceil N_{\mathrm{exact}} \right\rceil

The applied delay and quantization error are:

\tau_{\mathrm{applied}} = \frac{N_{\mathrm{integer}}}{F_s}

e_q = \tau_{\mathrm{applied}} - \tau

The quantization error depends on the fractional part of
N_exact; therefore, it does not increase linearly with distance or decrease
linearly with elevation. With upward quantization it remains non-negative and
less than one sample period.

The free-space path loss is:

L_{\mathrm{FSPL}} = 20\log_{10}\left(\frac{4\pi d_{\mathrm{slant}}f_c}{c}\right)

When all supported loss components are enabled:

L_{\mathrm{total}} = L_{\mathrm{FSPL}} + L_{\mathrm{clutter}}
+ L_{\mathrm{shadow}} + L_{\mathrm{BEL}} + L_{\mathrm{gas}}
+ L_{\mathrm{rain}}

The calibrated loss and IQ amplitude gain are:

L_{\mathrm{applied}} = \max\left(0,
L_{\mathrm{total}}-L_{\mathrm{offset}}\right)

G_{\mathrm{IQ}} = 10^{-L_{\mathrm{applied}}/20}

If fixed Doppler is enabled, the received samples are processed as:

y[n] = G_{\mathrm{IQ}}x[n]e^{j\phi[n]}

As elevation decreases, the slant range, physical propagation delay, and FSPL
increase. This trend is physically consistent. The quantization errors do not
follow the same monotonic trend because each value is determined by a different
fractional sample residual.

10. Verification Procedure

Use the following sequence for an initial verification:

Select forced_los, an outdoor terminal, zero fixed Doppler, and a fixed
random seed.

Disable optional loss components.

Verify slant range and elevation from the configured coordinates.

Recalculate one-way delay using d_slant / c.

Recalculate FSPL using the logged distance and runtime carrier frequency.

Verify that integer_samples = ceil(exact_samples).

Verify that the quantization error is between zero and one sample period.

Enable clutter, shadow fading, BEL, gas, and rain individually.

Confirm that each enabled component appears in total_loss.

Repeat the run with the same seed and verify reproducible random results.

11. Basic Troubleshooting

Observation

Check

No HAPS ACTIVE message

Confirm that HAPS_3GPP_ITU is registered and selected

HAPS configuration is not found

Check that RFsimulator model_name matches the hapsmod record

Delay is not reported

Check the delay enable flag and channel_offset integration

An optional loss remains zero

Check its enable flag and whether the selected link state permits that loss

BEL remains zero

Confirm that the terminal is configured as indoor

Clutter remains zero

Confirm that the selected link is NLOS

Results change between runs

Use the same configuration and random_seed

Applied loss looks unexpectedly small

Check link_budget_offset_db

Gas calculation is rejected

Check the implemented frequency and elevation limits

12. Current Limitations

1 × 1 SISO operation only

Static HAPS and UE geometry

Fixed Doppler supplied through configuration

Integer-sample propagation delay only

No fractional-delay filtering

No NTN-TDL fast fading

No delay-spread or Rice K-factor processing

No MIMO channel processing

No internal channel noise model

No cloud or scintillation attenuation

No HAPS-specific SIB19 signalling

Gas and rain models require further end-to-end validation
