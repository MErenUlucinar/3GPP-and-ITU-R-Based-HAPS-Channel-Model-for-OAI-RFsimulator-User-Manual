# OAI RFsimulator HAPS Channel Model: 3GPP and ITU-R-Based HAPS Channel Emulation for OAI RFsimulator

An experimental High-Altitude Platform Station (HAPS) channel model for the
OpenAirInterface (OAI) RFsimulator. The implementation combines a static
WGS-84-based HAPS-to-UE geometry with large-scale propagation effects based on
3GPP TR 38.811 and selected ITU-R recommendations.

> **Current version:** v0.1.0 — Experimental

> This project is a research prototype. It is not an official 3GPP or ITU
> conformance implementation.

## Overview

The model calculates the HAPS-to-UE link geometry and large-scale propagation
losses, then applies the resulting amplitude gain, propagation delay, and
optional fixed Doppler shift to the received IQ samples in OAI RFsimulator.

## Model Components

| Component | Model or source |
|---|---|
| HAPS–UE geometry | WGS-84 |
| Free-space path loss | Friis equation |
| LOS probability, clutter, and shadow fading | 3GPP TR 38.811 |
| Building entry loss | ITU-R P.2109-2 |
| Atmospheric gas attenuation | ITU-R P.676-13 |
| Rain attenuation | ITU-R P.838-3 |
| IQ processing and sample delay | OAI RFsimulator integration |

Only the methods explicitly implemented in the source code are covered. The
project does not claim complete implementation of the referenced standards.

## Source Modules

| Module | Responsibility |
|---|---|
| `haps_config.c/.h` | Reads and validates HAPS configuration parameters |
| `haps_geometry.c/.h` | Computes ECEF coordinates, slant range, elevation, and delay |
| `haps_propagation.c/.h` | Computes LOS/NLOS state and large-scale propagation losses |
| `haps_gas.c/.h` | Computes oxygen and water-vapour attenuation |
| `haps_rain.c/.h` | Computes fixed rain-layer attenuation |
| `haps_channel.c/.h` | Connects the model to the RFsimulator IQ processing path |

```

## Core Equations

The one-way propagation delay is calculated as:

```math
\tau = \frac{d_{\mathrm{slant}}}{c}
```

The free-space path loss is:

```math
L_{\mathrm{FSPL}} = 20\log_{10}\left(\frac{4\pi d_{\mathrm{slant}}f_c}{c}\right)
```

When all supported loss components are enabled:

```math
L_{\mathrm{total}} = L_{\mathrm{FSPL}} + L_{\mathrm{clutter}}
+ L_{\mathrm{shadow}} + L_{\mathrm{BEL}} + L_{\mathrm{gas}}
+ L_{\mathrm{rain}}
```

The applied loss is converted into a linear IQ amplitude gain:

```math
G_{\mathrm{IQ}} = 10^{-L_{\mathrm{applied}}/20}
```

## Basic Usage

The current model is integrated into the OAI RFsimulator source tree. A basic
setup consists of the following steps:

1. Add the HAPS source and header files to the RFsimulator source tree.
2. Register the `HAPS_3GPP_ITU` channel type.
3. Add the HAPS sources to the OAI build configuration.
4. Connect HAPS channel processing to `simulator.cpp`.
5. Copy and adapt the example
   [`channelmod_haps_3gpp_itu.conf`](examples/channelmod_haps_3gpp_itu.conf).
6. Build and run the RFsimulator, gNB, and UE.

For configuration, log interpretation, calculations, verification, and basic
troubleshooting, see the [User Guide](docs/USER_GUIDE.md). Exact build and run
commands must be published together with the tested OAI revision.

## Configuration

The HAPS parameters are read from the `hapsmod` list. Separate records can be
used for downlink and uplink:

```text
rfsimu_channel_enB0   # Downlink record
rfsimu_channel_ue0    # Uplink record
```

The initial reference configuration uses:

```text
Scenario       : rural
LOS mode       : forced_los
Terminal       : outdoor
HAPS altitude  : 20 km
Carrier        : 3.6192 GHz
Sample rate    : 61.44 Msps
Fixed Doppler  : 0 Hz
```

Additional propagation effects can be enabled or disabled through the HAPS
configuration flags.

## Expected Output

A successful initialization produces log messages containing the link
direction, geometry, propagation losses, Doppler, and delay.

```text
HAPS ACTIVE: link=rfsimu_channel_enB0 direction=DL
slant=20.000 km elevation=90.00 deg LOS=1
FSPL=129.64 dB CL=0.00 dB SF=0.00 dB BEL=0.00 dB

HAPS DELAY ACTIVE: one_way_delay=66.712819 us
integer_samples=4099
```

The exact output depends on the selected geometry, enabled loss components,
configuration values, and random seed.

## Reference Results

The following geometry results use a 20 km HAPS altitude and a 61.44 Msps
sample rate:

| Elevation | Slant range | One-way delay | Integer samples | FSPL at 3.6192 GHz |
|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| 90° | 20.000 km | 66.712819 µs | 4099 | 129.64 dB |
| 60° | 23.082 km | 76.993292 µs | 4731 | 130.89 dB |
| 30° | 39.814 km | 132.806663 µs | 8160 | 135.62 dB |
| 10° | 109.910 km | 366.619393 µs | 22526 | 144.44 dB |

These values are intended as reference calculations for geometry, FSPL, and
integer-sample delay verification. The same dataset, including exact sample
counts, applied delays, and quantization errors, is available in
[`validation/reference_results.csv`](validation/reference_results.csv).

## Current Limitations

- `1 × 1` SISO operation only
- Static HAPS and UE geometry
- Fixed Doppler supplied through configuration
- Integer-sample propagation delay only
- No fractional-delay filtering
- No NTN-TDL fast fading
- No delay-spread or Rice K-factor processing
- No MIMO channel processing
- No cloud or scintillation attenuation
- No HAPS-specific SIB19 signalling
- Gas and rain models require further end-to-end validation
